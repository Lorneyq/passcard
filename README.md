# Passcard â€” Password Generator Web App

My pet project, which has come to me many times at once, because it is always at hand. The application has two modes - "Classic" (one password to choose from, and a difficulty level indicator) and "List" (several passwords, the number the user can choose himself), between which you can switch using a toggle switch. The password can be made more complicated by: special characters, numbers, uppercase, spaces. If the password does not fit - you can update it or change its length.
